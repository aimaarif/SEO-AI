I’m building a web-based SEO automation app and need you to create the frontend UI that covers the entire workflow, with an attractive, clean design.

🧩 App Concept:
The app automates keyword research, content creation, editorial approval, social media sharing, and WordPress publishing — using AI agents (e.g., via LangChain/OpenAI/Claude).

🧠 Core User Flows:
Scheduled Keyword Research — runs at 9am daily

Keyword Storage — results saved to Google Sheets (shown in UI table)

Content Brief Generator — evaluates best topic and creates a content brief

AI Content Writer — writes full article draft based on brief

Editor Approval Panel — Gmail-like approval with inline comments

If Approved:

Marked as "Approved" in Google Sheet

Sent to WordPress blog in Draft

Social media post is auto-generated

Image and infographic are generated

If Not Approved:

Editor writes feedback

Sent back to AI writer or alternate writer

Process loops again

🖥️ Pages to Create (with routing)
Use Next.js or React with page-based routing. Pages needed:

/dashboard – Overview of workflow, upcoming tasks, performance

/keyword-research – Trigger keyword agent, display table of results

/content-brief – Show suggested topics, edit content brief

/writer – AI-generated draft preview, editor to tweak or resubmit

/approval – Gmail-style comment + approve interface

/distribution – Show auto-generated social media post, image, infographic

/history – Logs of prompts, feedback, final posts

/settings – API key config, task scheduling, model selector

🎨 UI Design Guidelines:
Theme: Modern and minimal

Colors:

Background: Black

Text: White

Accent & CTA Buttons: #bff747

Typography: Use sans-serif, bold headings, clean readability

Components should include:

Cards (for content or task summaries)

Tables (keyword results, status)

Modal popups (for content preview or approval)

Toasts/snackbars (for success/failure alerts)

Toggle switches, sliders (in settings)

Tabs or steps (for multi-stage workflows)

🧩 Components to Create:
<KeywordTable /> – Renders keyword list with "Save to Google Sheet" button

<PromptEditor /> – Live-edit prompt for AI content brief

<ContentPreview /> – Article viewer with accept/reject buttons

<ApprovalPanel /> – Comment box + status switch (approve/request changes)

<SocialPreview /> – Social media post preview

<ImageGallery /> – Generated image + infographic viewer

<WorkflowCard /> – Shows status, task history in dashboard

<SettingsPanel /> – API keys, task scheduling UI

🧠 Notes:
Include dummy/mock data for now (we'll hook up backend/LLM later)

All buttons/flows should be clickable (even if static at first)

Add dark mode layout with light text and clear section dividers

Responsiveness is key — it should look great on desktop and mobile

✅ Stack:
Framework: React or Next.js

Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom theme using #bff747

Optional UI Lib: ShadCN or Headless UI if needed for modals/forms

📦 Output:
Generate a full frontend app scaffold that:

Has all routes and screens set up

Uses clean component structure

Includes attractive landing dashboard with bold modern layout

Allows easy integration with LangChain or LLM APIs later

Bonus: Add a small animation or micro-interaction on button click (e.g., on "Generate Brief" or "Send to Writer").
